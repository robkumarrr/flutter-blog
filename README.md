# Flutter Blog

This is my first time using flutter and with the assistance of various walkthroughs and documentation I have started to put together a simple blog app.

## Getting Started

Currently, this is a work-in-progress but I am thoroughly enjoying the process so far.
I plan to connect the app to a database to create a more comprehensive overall project.

Thanks for reading! Check back periodically for more updates on this project.
